# Lab 1: Passing Pollinators

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to learn the basics of importing data and creating a basic dashboard
- to build a few Observable Plot options
- to start iterating with visualizations to answer data questions

The assignment requirements are as follows:

1. Create a dashboard in the `index.md` file that answers all three questions posed in the lab below.
2. Submit your [deployed link](#4-set-up-your-github-pages-for-your-deployment) as a comment on the lab 1 commons post.

# Data Context

The local farm has some new observational data from their plots. They need your help to determine important trends about the bees and the flowers. They are hoping to know more about the three bee species observed, the flowers, and the ideal conditions. Specifically, your dashboard should answer:
  1. What is the body mass and wing span distribution of each pollinator species observed?
  2. What is the ideal weather (conditions, temperature, etc) for pollinating?
  3. Which flower has the most nectar production?

There are other pieces of data available, which could yeild additional interesting trends, but these questions are the most important. The data has been provided in one dataset, and already in the `/data` folder.
